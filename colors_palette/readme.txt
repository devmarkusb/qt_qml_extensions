Added an additional ExtColorsTestApp, which starts
ExtColorsTest.qml in a sound  app context, not just via qmlscene.

And surprise: the colors differ from plain view in qmlscene!
Reducing the excitement: only the alternateBase colors differ.
But perhaps you can't be sure what happens on various platforms.
